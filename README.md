# [Project 1: How Business Strategies can create a Bias](https://github.com/roesta07/How-Business-Strategies-can-create-bias/blob/main/README.md)
*Keywords: Causal Model, Directed Acyclic Graphs(DAG), Collider Bias, Bayesian Statistics, Python PYMC3*<br/>
A Business has to make a lot of strategies thus increasing the chance of biased interpretation. One of the main Culprits for biased interpretation and analysis in business is failing to consider the effects of strategies.

# [Project 2: Survival Analysis in Business](https://github.com/roesta07/Survival-Models-in-Businesses/blob/main/README.md)

*Keywords: Operations/Administration, Causal Model, Probabilistic Model, Bayesian Statistics, Python, Pymc3*

Businesses are often interested to know about the rate at which their customers enroll and quit. It is through these rates any business decides upon its customer retention strategies and evaluates lifetime values from each customer

# [Project 3: A-simple-Business-Question](https://github.com/roesta07/A-simple-Business-Question/blob/main/README.md)

*Keywords: Causal Model, Spurious Association, Bayesian Statistics, Python PYMC3*<br/>
A Slice of Profit and Loss account to answer a simple business question; weather our marketing driving profit or is it our innovation in product and service? We will be using Bayesian Statistics for this project.

# [Project 4: Modeling the Likert Scale](https://github.com/roesta07/Modeling-Likert-Scale/blob/main/README.md)

*Keywords: GLM, ordered logistics, Likert scale, Bayesian statistics, Pymc3*
Now and then; researchers have to use the Likert scale for measuring some variables because not all variables can be measured through engineering devices.
